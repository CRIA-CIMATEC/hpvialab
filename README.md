## üßê About <a name = "About"></a>

This study proposes a new synthetic dataset for the removal of low-light, glare, wrinkled paper, color temperature variation and shadow and evaluates its performance with some state of the art image enhancement and denoising neural networks.

The results was achieved as a partnership between HP Inc. R&D Brazil and SENAI CIMATEC, using incentives of the Brazilian Informatics Law (Law n¬∞. 8.2.48 of 1991).

Folders / files and descriptions:

    synthetic_defects/                   : Folder that contains the synthetic and ground-truth dataset.
        {gt_position}.jpg                : Ground-truth image name template. `gt_position` means 'ground-truth image position' and ranges from 0 to 9899.
        {gt_position}_{syn_position}.jpg : Synthetic image name template. `gt_position` means 'ground-truth image position' and ranges from 0 to 9899. `syn_position` means 'synthetic image position' and ranges from 0 to 2.
